# Form Elements Overview

This section introduces essential form elements, such as buttons and toggle switches, to help you build dynamic interfaces in your application.

## Button

The Button component is used for initiating actions, such as submitting a form or triggering navigation.

<Canvas of={ButtonStories.Primary} />

## ToggleSwitch

The ToggleSwitch component is used to enable or disable specific settings.

<Canvas of={ToggleSwitchStories.Default} />

## Form Example

Here is an example of how the Button and ToggleSwitch components work together in a simple interface:

- **Toggle Notifications**: Controlled by the ToggleSwitch component.
- **Submit Changes**: Triggered by the Button component.

To create this layout in your app, combine these components as shown below:

```jsx
import { Button } from './Button';
import { ToggleSwitch } from './ToggleSwitch';

export const SampleForm = () => (
  <form>
    <ToggleSwitch isOn={false} label="Enable Notifications" />
    <Button label="Submit" />
  </form>
);
